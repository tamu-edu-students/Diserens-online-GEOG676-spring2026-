#Take the following list and only add together those list items which are even. You can use the following snippet of code to see if a number is even or odd. The % operation is called Modulo and is used to find the remainder after division of one number by another. We divide by 2 and look at the remainder; if there is no remainder the number is even, if there is a remainder the number is odd.
